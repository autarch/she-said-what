<h1>This Site and She</h1>

<p>
She says a lot of strange things. She is not a native English speaker,
and she has a lot of strange thoughts. Put these two things together,
and hilarity results.  </p.

<p>
This site will attempt to document some of the strange things she says
for posterity and amusement.
